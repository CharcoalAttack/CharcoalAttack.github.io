This is the first post to go into receipt-rewards. I am super happy to announce that we will be moving past the old way of distributing steam game keys via our [Discord](https://discord.gg/sVdUh6F) channel and onto this website instead. While how we distribute them is still very much a WIP, I am happy to listen to any feedback on our current method. 

Due to problems with the honor system in the current discord server, keys will now have to be requested via discord DMs. If you see a game that you would like, just click the title of the game and I can provide the key, 

Here's is an example table of the method. All of the links provided are empty, but they would link to contact me for the key:

| Number | Game Title | Date Added |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| 1 | [This War of Mine]() | 09/15/2020 |
| 2 | [Imperator Rome]() | 11/07/2020 |
| 3 | [Dirt Rally]() | 12/23/2020 |
| 4 | [Moons of Madness]() | 12/27/2020 |
